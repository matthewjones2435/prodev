## Weekly Reflection 

I think the biggest takeaway for me this week, concerns itself with the professional development aspect of the bootcamp.  I feel that this aspect of the bootcamp will be on of the more challenging pieces for me, but I feel that it will also be the most rewarding.  I feel that the excercises we had worked on during the week, has helped me to realize that although I have a different background from the technology field I still have plenty to offer to employers within the tech market.  I also realized that many of what I would have typically considered strength characteristics could have also been a hinderance for me in the past. For example, I am and would consider myself to be a very dependable and loyal employee, and although I have seen this as a strength I am now able to see that there have more than likely been many instances in a work setting where this characteristic has been used against me, or used as a carrot to lead me into a direction that my employers would have never intended to reward me with, just to keep the hard work out of me.
