## Week One- Purpose

### What
  * Use of coding/programming for the development of software for music and audio applications. 
  
### Why

 * Because I am passionate about music, and the technological innovations that have effected how music is created in the digital age.

### How 

 * Through exploration and experimentation with audio softwares and hardwares that will lead to the development of unique and interesting user experiences when creating thier music.  

### Q and Q

 * Quantative 
   * Worked 7 or more years with out calling out sick once.  
   * Worked with fellow associates to raise store sales to the goal of $20,000 per week, which was a goal set upon us by our      owners and managers
   * I had worked for World of Warcraft, and at the time I had little knowledge of the game as I did not play it, but I worked hard and adapted so that I was able to meet the hourly ticket quota of 10 tickets per hour, while still being able to produce auality service and adhere to to outlined policies of the job.
   
 * Qualitative 
   * Reliable and Loyalty, I had been raised to take these types of qualities as important, and to an extent they are quite important, but this is a type of a quality that can be taken advantage of.  
   * Empathy, in the field of customer service empathy can be an important quality that can be used to graciously aid a customer 
   with thier needs, but it could be a double edged sword in the fact that it can make you feel like you are not being as helpful as you can when a situation arises when you actually unable to help someone becuase of policies etc.
   * Organization, I am typically an organized individual and feel that basic organization is an important aspect of productive workflow ets, but also I feel that this quality can get in the way in being that if something is not organized in particular ways or to my preferences it can become a burden because I would feel that it would need to be reorganized before and real work done would be done. 


## Weekly Reflection 

I think the biggest takeaway for me this week, concerns itself with the professional development aspect of the bootcamp.  I feel that this aspect of the bootcamp will be on of the more challenging pieces for me, but I feel that it will also be the most rewarding.  I feel that the excercises we had worked on during the week, has helped me to realize that although I have a different background from the technology field I still have plenty to offer to employers within the tech market.  I also realized that many of what I would have typically considered strength characteristics could have also been a hinderance for me in the past. For example, I am and would consider myself to be a very dependable and loyal employee, and although I have seen this as a strength I am now able to see that there have more than likely been many instances in a work setting where this characteristic has been used against me, or used as a carrot to lead me into a direction that my employers would have never intended to reward me with, just to keep the hard work out of me.
